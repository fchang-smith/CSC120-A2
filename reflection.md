What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Generally, the coding process goes frequently, except that I am not sure how to correctly import another file by using the command "from xxx import xxx, xxx, xxx,...". Probably because I know basic knowledge about class in python, this assignment is not very hard form me.
